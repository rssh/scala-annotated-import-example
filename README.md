scala-annotated-import-example
==============================

This is code examples, which illustrated annotated-imports presip.

To use one you need:

1.  get patched scala compiler from git@github.com:rssh/scala.git

2.  switch in one to branch 'annotated-import' and compile compiler

3.  return to scala-annotated-import-example and set in config.sh path to
  directory where patched compiler is situated.

4.  scalac.sh can be used for compiling;  scaladoc - for creating scaladoc in API dir.
